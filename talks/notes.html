<h1 id="organisation">Organisation</h1>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>The rooms E422 (Mondays 9 - 10) and MT233 (Mondays 1 - 2) are reserved for us for the duration of the project. For the first week Dr O'Brien shall introduce the project in these two sessions and take you through some of the material. For the subsequent weeks you can use these rooms as meeting points and Dr O'Brien can come along as necessary to support you in your work on the project.</p>
<p>Please keep in regular contact with the other members of your group and inform Dr O'Brien of your progress and any problems that arise. Perhaps we can exchange emails by the end of play on Friday to make a plan for the meeting(s) on Monday.</p>
<h2 id="report-submission-poster-presentation">Report submission &amp; poster presentation</h2>
<p>The group's report should be submitted to the Coursework Receipting Office using the blue postboxes by <strong>Friday 04 April 2014</strong>. One copy of the report should be submitted but there must be a coursework submission cover sheet for <strong>each student in the group</strong>, see <a href="http://coursework.mmu.ac.uk/">http://coursework.mmu.ac.uk/</a> for further details.</p>
<p>The poster presentation will take place in the week beginning Monday 28 April 2014, time and location to follow. After the poster presentation you should anonymously mark each of your fellow group members with a mark out of 10 for their performance on the whole of this project, and send these marks to Dr O'Brien. Further information on the group marking procedure and posters is available from the Moodle Mini-project area.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-tilings">Introduction to tilings</h1>
<p>We are all familiar to some degree with the way tiles are used to provide functional and aesthetic coverings to floors and walls in human constructions. The way that one or more basic tile shapes can be used in a reetitive way to cover a surface motivates the idea of a mathematical tiling.</p>
<h2 id="basic-definition">Basic definition</h2>
<p>The term <em>tiling</em> refers to a covering of the plane <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> with a collection of shapes called <em>tiles</em>. We normally assume that the tiles are all <em>toplogical discs</em>, which means roughly that they are each a continuous deformation of a disc, that their boundary is a simple closed curve and that they do not contain any holes. In the tiling we assume that the whole plane has been covered and that the tiles do not overlap, except where two tiles meet and share part of their boundaries. For examples of mathematical tilings consult the many figures in <em>Tilings by Regular polygons -- II</em> by Chavey (1989) and <em>The eighty-one types of isohedral tilings in the plane</em> by Grunbaum &amp; Shephard (1977). A mathematical problem that tilings present is, in a nutshell, to classify them, to be able to say when two given tilings, although they may seem superficially different, are nevertheless of the same <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>Note that the tilings in Chavey's paper all consist of tiles which are regular polygons, though a tiling may feature tiles of more than one shape, whereas in Grunbaum &amp; Shephard's paper some of the tilings shown feature tiles that are not regular poygons, though in each tiling, all the tiles are the same shape. A moment's reflection should reveal that to attempt a classification of all tilings as we have defined them in the previouys paragraph would be a monumental task due to the bewildering number of possibilities. So all the classifications that have been carried out to date always begin by placing careful restrictions on the tilings considered and precisely defining a notion of the <em>type</em> of a tiling, and then proceeding to carry out the classification.</p>
<h1 id="guidelines-for-your-reports">Guidelines for your reports</h1>
<p>The report will give an introduction to the mathematical notion of tilings and some of the connections with tilings in art and architechture. It will give an description of the general problem of classifying tilings and some of the ways that this has been approached and in particular will focus on and give an exposition of the classification of <em>isohedral</em> tilings carried out by Grunbaum &amp; Shephard (1977). There is ample scope for expanding on the descriptions and explanations in this paper.</p>
<h1 id="symmetry">Symmetry</h1>
<p>Classifications of geometric constructions such as tilings often involve describing the symmetries of the construction. A symmetry of a tiling of the plane is an <em>isometric</em> transformation of the plane which preserves the tiling as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="isometries-of-the-plane">Isometries of the plane</h2>
<p>An <em>isometric</em> transformation, or <em>isometry</em>, of the plane is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) mapping <span class="math">\(\phi : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> which preserves lengths of vectors, i.e. <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad |\phi(\mathbf{x})| = | \mathbf{x} |.\]</span></p>
<p>A non-identity isometry, <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, of the plane is always one of three types: a translation, a rotation, a reflection or a glide reflection. The identity isometry, the translations and rotations are all referred to as <em>direct</em> isometries. The reflections and glide reflections are referred to as <em>indirect</em> ismetries.</p>
<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>
<p>A translation by a fixed vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{d}\)</span> is the isometry <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{d}.\]</span></p>
<h3 id="rotations">Rotations</h3>
<p>A rotation about the origin by an angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is the isometry <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad \phi(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x},\]</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the rotation matrix <span class="math">\[A = \begin{pmatrix}\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>In general, a rotation about a fixed point, with position vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span>, through an angle <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is the isometry <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{c} + A(\mathbf{x}- \mathbf{c}),\]</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the rotation matrix above.</p>
<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>A reflection in the line through the origin making an angle of <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> with the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis is the isometry defined by <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad \phi(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x},\]</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the reflection matrix <span class="math">\[A = \begin{pmatrix}\cos 2\theta &amp; \sin 2\theta \\ \sin 2\theta &amp; -\cos 2\theta \end{pmatrix}.\]</span></p>
<p>In general, a relection in the line through a point <span class="math">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span> which makes an angle of <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> with the line through <span class="math">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span> parallel to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis the isometry defined by <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{c} + A(\mathbf{x}- \mathbf{c}),\]</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the reflection matrix above.</p>
<h3 id="glide-reflections">Glide reflections</h3>
<p>A glide reflection consists of a reflection followed by a translation by a vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{g}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\mathbf{g}\)</span> is parallel to the direction of the reflection axis. A glide reflection can be expressed as the isometry <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\[ \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \quad \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{g} + \psi(\mathbf{x}),\]</span> where <span class="math">\(\psi\)</span> is a reflection as defined in the previous section.</p>
<h2 id="symmetry-group-of-x">Symmetry group of <span class="math">\(X\)</span></h2>
<p>If you have two symmetries, <span class="math">\(\phi_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi_2\)</span> of an object <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, i.e. isometries that leave the object unchanged as a whole, then if we compose the isometries as <span class="math">\(\phi_3 = \phi_2 \circ \phi_1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\phi_3\)</span> will again be an isometry and also a symmetry of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>A symmetry group of a geometric object <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in the plane is the group consisting of all isometries of the plane which are symmetries of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, i.e. leave <span class="math">\(X\)</span> unchanged as a whole. The group operation in a symmetry group is always that of composition. In your work on tilings you will encounter the dihedral groups <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n \geq 3\)</span>. The dihedral group <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span> is the group of symmetries of a regular <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-sided polygon. The elements of the group <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math">\[D_n = \left \{ r^i , r^i s \, : \, 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \right \},\]</span> where <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the rotation about the centre of the polygon by an angle of <span class="math">\(2\pi/n\)</span> in a counter-clockwise direction and <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is any reflectional symmetry in one of the axes of reflectional symmetry of the polygon. Note that <span class="math">\(r^0 =e\)</span>, the identity symmetry, and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(s\)</span> satisfy the relation <span class="math">\[sr^i = r^{-i} s, \quad (1 \leq i \leq n-1).\]</span> Here the products <span class="math">\(xy\)</span> always denote the composition <span class="math">\(x \circ y\)</span> and in these dihedral groups <span class="math">\(r^{-i} = r^{m-i}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(1 \leq i \leq m-1\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="glossary-of-terms">Glossary of terms</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some of the common technical terms you will encounter in reading the Grunbaum &amp; Shephard paper but that aren't defined there, along with a brief definition or reference where you can find it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>closed topological disc</strong>: as defined above, a region of the plane which is a continuous deformation of a disc, whose boundary is a simple closed curve and the region does not contain any holes. The prefix <em>closed</em> indicates that the region includes the points that make up its boundary.</li>
<li><strong>congruent</strong>: two regions of the plane are congruent if they are related by an isometry and maybe a scaling transformation, i.e. if they are the 'same' shape.</li>
<li><strong>connected set</strong>: a subset of the plane is connected if it is made up of one single piece. Defining this precisely and rigourously is quite technical, but for our purposes of tilings it simply means that a tile consists of a single 'piece of material' and does not consist of the union of two or more disjoint pieces.</li>
<li><strong>cyclic group <span class="math">\(C_n\)</span></strong>: the cyclic group <span class="math">\(C_n\)</span> is the group of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements that can be generated by a single element.</li>
<li><strong>dihedral group <span class="math">\(D_n\)</span></strong>: see section above.</li>
<li><strong>disjoint</strong>: two sets are disjoint if their intersection is empty.</li>
<li><strong>isomorphic</strong>: two groups are isomorphic if they have the same group structure, i.e. if there exists a bijective mapping, <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, between them which satisfies the homorphism property <span class="math">\(\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y)\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>subgroup</strong>: a subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> of a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a subset <span class="math">\(H \subset G\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is itself a group under the same group operation working in <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.</li>
