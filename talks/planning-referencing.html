<h3 id="what-is-a-plan-anyway">What is a plan anyway?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A calendar schedule for completing the tasks associated to the project.</li>
<li>Make it detailed: week-by-week from now until submission.</li>
<li>Keep it visible: wallchart? Google Calendar? Smartphone app?</li>
<li>Have a flexible plan: allow it to change, incorporate new tasks, abandon unneccessary tasks,</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-tasks">What are the tasks?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>&quot;Doing the work&quot;
<ul>
<li>Understanding new mathematics</li>
<li>Solving new problems / carrying out statistical analysis / OR analysis / mathematical modelling ...</li>
<li>Presenting material in different ways</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>Poster preparation</li>
<li>Presentation preparation</li>
<li>Constructing physical models</li>
<li>...</li>

<h1>Tasks: Reading</h1>
<ul>
<li>Keep it active</li>
<li>Test understanding: work on exercises, fill in missing details, gaps, ...</li>
<li>Make notes as you read ...</li>
<li>... these notes become your first drafts</li>
</ul>

<div class="section slide level2" id="tasks-doing-the-work">
<h1>Tasks: &quot;Doing the work&quot;</h1>
<ul>
<li>When does this happen?
<ul>
<li>In defined period, or throughout project?</li>
<li>Divide into smaller achievable tasks</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>Tasks: Writing</h1>
<h3 id="your-history">Your history</h3>
<ul>
<li>How experienceed are you writing long pieces?</li>
<li>How long ago was it?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-writing-process">The writing process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recognise the need for drafting &amp; re-drafting &amp; re-drafting ...</li>
<li>Don't try and make it perfect first time.</li>
<li>From now have a draft Table of Contents and
<ul>
<li>use this to organise your approach,</li>
<li>use this as a menu to pick and choose writing tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You don't have to write from beginning to end.</p></li>
<li>Writing throughout the project period allows you to
<ul>
<li>get technical details down while they're fresh in your mind,</li>
<li>have a break from reading.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Introduction chapter &amp; abstract will probably be written near submission, as
<ul>
<li>you can't properly introduce what isn't already there.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have sources of feedback
<ul>
<li>Your own re-reading &amp; proofreading</li>
<li>Friends and colleagues</li>
<li>Supervisor</li>

<h1>Tasks: Writing</h1>
<h3 id="a-useful-exercise-to-help-writing">A useful exercise to help writing</h3>
<p>I have found a daily writing practice (free writing) helps my 'serious' writing. This technique was popularised by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Goldberg">Natalie Goldberg</a> amongst others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do this regulary and ideally every day.</li>
<li>Set timer for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Write constantly for these 10 minutes without stopping.</li>
<li>Content, grammar, punctation, etc are not important.</li>
<li>Write about mathematics, your plans for the day, reflections on yesterday, ...</li>
<li>Do not stop writing. If you can't think of anything then ...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write.</p>

</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="coding">
<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>If you plan to include computer code in your report then it needs to be ...</p>
<ul>
<li>well structured,</li>
<li>adequately commented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best done as you write the code?</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="tasks-poster-presentation">
<h1>Tasks: Poster &amp; presentation</h1>
<ul>
<li>See later project talk</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="the-plan">
<h1>The plan</h1>
<ul>
<li>Your plan will have to incorporate all the relevant tasks in a realistic way.</li>
<li>Beware other coursework deadlines and make use of quieter times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid the naive plan of</p>
<ul>
<li>Do all the reading now ...</li>
<li>... and then do all the writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the drawbacks of this approach?</p>
<p>A plan which mixes the tasks we've discussed throughout the project period will provide an interesting mix of different work activities and help you to make consistent progress on all fronts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="referencing-1">
<h1>Referencing</h1>
<h3 id="the-purpose-of-referencing">The purpose of referencing</h3>
<p>Two of the main reasons are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To give due credit to other authors for the use of their ideas.</p></li>
<li>To allow your reader to investigate your work further by
<ul>
<li>checking your claimed sources,</li>
<li>finding out more about the ideas you refer to.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="referencing-systems">Referencing systems</h3>
<p>There are many systems for referencing in use. They combine brief <strong>citations</strong> within the text which refer to full <strong>bibliographic</strong> information about the sources which appears in a list of references at the end of the text and/or in footnotes at the bottom of pages containing citations.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Numeric</em> reference systems are quite common in mathematics and involve a numbered list of references at the end of the text which are cited by number in the text.
<ul>
<li>In widespread use by many books and journals.</li>
<li>But numeric citations convey no information and require interrupting flow of reading if any information about author or age of work is required.</li>
<li>Reference lists not always sorted alphabetically by author surname.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Author Date</em> reference systems use <strong>citations</strong> consisting of author(s) surname(s) and publication year which refer to full <strong>bibliographic</strong> entries which are listed at the end of the text, sorted alphabetically by the (leading) author's surname.
<ul>
<li>Requires slightly more effort to implement than numeric systems</li>
<li>But citations now convey relevant information</li>
<li>Reduces need to interrupt flow of reading</li>
<li>Reference lists are always sorted alphabetically</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="the-harvard-referencing-style">
<h1>The Harvard Referencing style</h1>
<ul>
<li>You are required to use the Harvard reference style.</li>
<li>Fully specified in the Faculty's <a href="http://www.library.mmu.ac.uk/helpsheet/mmuharvard1.php">guide</a></li>
<li>Pay careful attention to the specific details re ordering, punctuation, use of italics etc and apply consistently.</li>
